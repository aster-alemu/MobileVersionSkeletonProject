This is the second project at Microverse first week activity.
- After creating the remote repository clone it using the command git clone git@github.com:aster-alemu/MobileVersionSkeletonProject.git
- The next step was to make sure that there is no linter errors and for this I set-up gitHub actions and set-up linters in my local environment using the terminal
- Then create branch repository using the command git branch which is followed by the name of new branch
- After creating the branch repository, switch from main branch to new branch using the command git checkout which is followed by the name of new branch created
- Then create index.html file and write the contents
- After that I create style.css file and link with the index.html file using the link tag
- Then seening the result by opening the index.html file using Live Server
- I check the if there is style errors by runing the command npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"
- I check if there is error on html file by runing the command npx hint . on the terminal
- Then stage the all the files using the command git add . on the terminal
- Then update the file using the command git commit -m followed by the commit message with double qouts on the terminal
